Leave Feed or Fodder in your livestock's Feeding Bins once a day, or give it to them directly to raise their affection. You can also talk to them and brush them to make them even happier!<br><br>Don't neglect to feed your animals! Babies can't grow if they don't eat, and unfed adults won't produce byproducts.
